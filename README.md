Design project code

Coding Practice for Team 1 (pls follow):
1. Camel case with underscores and type in the front for variables.
	ex~ ci_Motor_Speed 
	
2. Camel case, no underscores with capital for the first letter for functions.
	ex~ EncoderRun()
	
3. Comment as much as you can.

4. Commit and push at the end of each day that you change something. 

5. Only commit to your own branch and then merge to MASTER once you're done.

6. Only put code in the repository.
